Instructions

Try this exercise to understand how tests work with inputs in Auditorium. Write some code that multiples together the two numbers in the input area. When you run the tests, different inputs will replace the ones in the input area and pass the new inputs through your code.

Important

Your code has to work for all the different input sets. e.g.
print(6)

This is not correct, because it only works for one set of inputs. You should only print one number into the output.


-----------------


Instructions
Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name.

Important
Don't add a prompt to the input() function.
e.g. use

name = input()

rather than:
name = input("What's your name?")

input() will give you access to anything that's typed in the input pane.

Hint
You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
