Overview
=======

In this documentation, I will provide an overview of my learning experience with the Blackjack project. The project was designed to help me learn and expand my coding skillset, and it provided a challenging and rewarding experience. In this document, I will emphasize the key takeaways from the project and how they helped me improve my coding abilities.

Learnings
=========

The Blackjack project was a comprehensive learning experience that covered a wide range of topics. Here are some of the key learnings I gained from the project, organized by perceived developer skill level:

Beginner
--------

1. Basic data structures and functions: The project introduced me to basic data structures such as lists and tuples, and functions for performing tasks such as random number generation and card drawing.
2. Conditional statements and loops: I learned how to use conditional statements (if/else) and loops (for) to control the flow of my code and create more complex logic.
3. Basic object-oriented programming: The project provided an introduction to object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance.

Advanced
--------

1. Object-oriented programming: I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming principles and how to apply them effectively in my code.
2. Modular design: The project emphasized the importance of modular design, and I learned how to break down my code into smaller, more manageable modules.
3. Debugging and error handling: I improved my ability to debug my code and handle errors gracefully, which is essential for any software development project.

Expert
======

1. Algorithm design: The Blackjack game required me to design and implement a basic strategy algorithm that could play the game optimally. This helped me understand the importance of algorithm design and how to approach it systematically.
2. Code optimization: I learned how to optimize my code for better performance, which is crucial for any software development project.
3. Testing and verification: The project emphasized the importance of testing and verifying my code, and I gained experience in writing unit tests and using them to ensure that my code works correctly.

Conclusion
==========

In conclusion, the Blackjack project was a comprehensive learning experience that helped me improve my coding abilities and gain a deeper understanding of software development principles. The project's challenging nature and well-structured codebase provided an excellent opportunity for me to learn and grow as a developer. I am confident that the skills and knowledge I gained from this project will serve me well in future software development projects.
