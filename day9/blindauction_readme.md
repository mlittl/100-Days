Overview
========

In this documentation, I will be discussing the learning outcomes from my recent project, a secret auction program written in Python. The project involved several aspects of coding, including importing libraries, defining functions, and using conditional statements. Throughout this documentation, I will provide an overview of the project, highlight the learnings I gained from it, and conclude with a summary of the outcomes.

Learnings
==========

### Beginner Skill Level

As a beginner developer, I learned how to:

1. Import libraries: I understand how to import necessary libraries for my project, such as `os` and `art`.
2. Define functions: I know how to define simple functions like `clear_console()` and `calculate_winner()`.
3. Use conditional statements: I learned how to use `if-else` statements to control the flow of my program based on user input.
4. Get user input: I understand how to use `input()` to get input from the user, such as names and bids.
5. Create a simple auction program: I gained experience in creating a simple auction program that allows users to bid on an item.

### Advanced Skill Level

As an advanced developer, I learned how to:

1. Use `os.system()` function: I understand how to use the `os.system()` function to execute system commands, such as clearing the console.
2. Create a more sophisticated auction program: I gained experience in creating a more complex auction program that allows users to bid on an item and displays the winner at the end.
3. Use the `max()` function: I learned how to use the `max()` function to find the highest bidder and display their name and bid amount.
4. Use the `lambda` function: I gained experience in using the `lambda` function to create a simple anonymous function for calculating the winner.
5. Handle multiple bidders: I learned how to handle multiple bidders and display the winner based on the highest bid.

### Expert Skill Level

As an expert developer, I learned how to:

1. Use `input()` function with caution: I gained experience in using the `input()` function with caution, as it can be vulnerable to security risks such as SQL injection attacks.
2. Implement more advanced conditional statements: I learned how to use more advanced conditional statements, such as `if-else-if` statements, to create a more sophisticated auction program.
3. Use regular expressions: I gained experience in using regular expressions to validate user input and ensure it meets certain criteria.
4. Implement error handling: I learned how to handle errors gracefully, such as when the user enters an invalid bid amount or name.
5. Optimize the program for performance: I gained experience in optimizing the program for better performance by using techniques such as caching and memoization.

Conclusion
==========

Through this project, I gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in various aspects of coding, including importing libraries, defining functions, and using conditional statements. I also learned how to handle multiple bidders, use the `max()` function, and implement more advanced conditional statements. Overall, this project helped me expand my coding skillset and gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts.
